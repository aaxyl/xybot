# xybot

This is the (very icky single file) source code for the Discord.py based AI bot "xybot", mostly generated by DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen GGUF 14b, then bugfixed by hand

Ollama API IP address is set to localhost by default - this is assuming you're running main.py on the same machine as your Ollama instance

Port is 11434 (both IP and port can be changed in the code itself - `api_url` is the variable you want to modify)

You will need to provide your own Discord bot token from the developer's section on Discord's website (the place to change token in main.py is located near the bottom)
