# xybot

This is the (very icky single file) source code for the Discord.py based AI bot "xybot"

Ollama API IP address is set to localhost by default (assuming you're running code on the same machine as your Ollama instance), port is 11434 (both can be changed in the code itself)

You will need to provide the Discord bot token yourself from the developer's page on Discord's website
